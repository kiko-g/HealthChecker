## About

Health is an increasing concern in modern society People are more focused on their well being than ever. Information about diseases is very widely spread and often split into niches. It either is too technically detailed or simply too generalist and doesn't provide a useful insight for the users. With that being said our team created Health Checker in the context of a Semantic Web and Linked Data course taught at FEUP MEIC, a web platform to consult accurate medically approved information and aims to save research time and help you expand your knowledge!
